NAME
    Games::Snake - A simple version of the classic Snake video game

SYNOPSIS
        perl snake.pl

    Or for 2-player:

        perl snake2p.pl

    By default, the game will connect to a server to determine the
    IP address and port of the other player.  If you are using public
    IP address, or both players are on the same network, you can specify
    the remote IP address and port number directly.

    Options:
        --laddr     Local IP address
        --lport     Local port number
        --raddr     Remote player IP address
        --rport     Remote player port number
        --saddr     Server IP address
        --sport     Server port number
